# RumorNAS: Bi-directional Search to Stack Dynamic GNN for Rumor Detection

## Overview
This is the code for our paper **RumorNAS: Bi-directional Search to Stack Dynamic GNN for Rumor Detection**
It is a bi-directional differentiable architecture search  framework based on dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) for rumor detection .

## Requirementsï¼š

To execute this project, it's essential to install the required dependencies. To do so, navigate to the directory containing the `requirements.txt` file and execute the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Instructions to run the experiment
To execute the project, run the following command in your terminal:

**Step 1.** Run the search process, given different random seeds.
(The Twitter15 dataset with 5 snapshots is used as an example)
```
python Libs/Exp/search.py
```
The results are saved in the directory `Output/Logs/`, e.g., `Search-RumorNAS-Twitter15-temporal-SnapshotNum=5`.

**Step 2.** Fine tune the searched architectures. You need specify the arch_filename with the resulting filename from Step 1.
```
python Libs/Exp/finetune.py
```
Step 2 is a coarse-graind tuning process, and the results are saved in a picklefile in the directory `Finetune`.
